# Poker Skill, Hands, and Bet Limits Capstone Project
## Overview
This project explores how poker skill, hand quality, and bet limits affect a player’s final cash balance using a simulated dataset. I applied Bayesian statistics to analyze the main effects and interactions between these factors.

a Game of Skill or Chance? A Quasi-Experimental Study," Journal of Gambling 
Studies, Online First DOI 10.1007/s10899-012-9327-8.
The dataset consists of 25 individuals in each of 12 different experimental conditions, resulting in a total of 300 observations. The factors being analyzed are:
- Skill
- Hand
- Limit
- Final Cash Balance
## Key Takeaways
I found that skill and hand quality had the biggest impact on winnings, while bet limits had a smaller effect. This project highlighted the importance of choosing the right model and considering prior knowledge when analyzing data. I’d like to refine the model and explore more factors, like player behavior, to improve the analysis.
